title: Smart door lock
description: "The project essentially involves creating a digitally coded lock card that provides the user with complete security. During the implementation of our project, we must adhere to specifications that impose the following conditions: The project must be programmed to meet the following requirements: Allow the owner to enter the 4-digit code. Change the code. Allow the owner to open the door using their fingerprint. Allow the owner to open the door using their RFID card. Allow the owner to open the door using a push button inside."
skills: 
  - Arduino
  - ESP32
  - C#
  - Embedded Systems

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">üéØ Objectives</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li>Enhance urban traffic management using a smart, sensor-based approach.</li>
      <li>Reduce wait time and optimize vehicle flow at intersections.</li>
      <li>Build a scalable embedded system prototype using real-time components.</li>
    </ul>

   <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools</h2>
    <ul class="list-disc ml-6 mb-4">
      <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> Arduino UNO, IR sensors, LEDs, Buzzer, LCD display</li>
      <li><strong>Software:</strong> Arduino IDE, Proteus for simulation, C/C++ for programming</li>
      <li><strong>Communication:</strong> Serial monitor for debugging, analog & digital inputs</li>
    </ul>

   <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">üß† How It Works</h2>
    <p class="mb-4">
      The system uses IR sensors placed at road sections to detect the number of vehicles. The microcontroller (Arduino UNO) processes these inputs to decide which lane gets a green light and for how long. The logic ensures that heavily congested lanes are prioritized, and all directions get fair passage. The status of lights and timers is displayed on an LCD.
